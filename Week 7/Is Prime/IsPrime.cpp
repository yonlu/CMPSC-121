/*
 * Sieve of Eratosthenes!
 *
 * When the counter hits 2, we can eliminate all multiples of 2.
 * When it hits 3, eliminate all its multiples.
 * Notice how 6 is already a multiple of 2 and therefore, already eliminated.
 * So starting eliminating multiples of 3 at the square of 3. Which is 9.
 *
 * 4 is a multiple of 2, so it's already eliminated.
 *
 * Counter hits 5, but 10 (multiple of 2) is already eliminated,
 * and so is 15 (multiple of 3) and 20 (multiple of 2).
 * Start counting at its square root (25).
 *
 * Repeat this pattern for all non-eliminated numbers.
 *
 * When you hit 11, 11 squared is already bigger than 100 (our limit).
 * Now all remaining numbers are prime.
